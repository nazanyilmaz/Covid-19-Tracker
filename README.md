<h1>Covid-19 Tracker</h1>

<p>
  I developed a Covid-19 tracker with React. The tests of the project were carried out with unit testing. About the project: The latest data coming from the API is data for March 2023. The project was created based on the data received up to this date. You can access the country details by clicking on the country on the map and searching. Skeleton was used for the loading screen. An error page has been created for countries that do not share their data. About the test:
A total of 6 separate tests for 3 different pages were successfully passed. Some of the tests are combined with the describe feature. The project can be used using different data.</p>
